## Tutorials
<div style="text-align: justify">
GaudiMM was designed and built with modularity and extensibility in mind. Gpath follows the same philosophy. 
  
It means that users can construct their calculations by combining several different modules and configure them with diverse options. 
If they are interested, they can even dive into the code documentation and expand or construct their own extensions or new functionalities.

The counterpart is that, at times, it can be a bit difficult for a new user who wants to set up a simple calculation and see if the program can meet his/her needs.

That is why this tutorial section was born. Concretely, its objectives are:
</div>
- Provide a practical vision of the program capabilities.
- Teach, step by step, how a calculation has to be prepared and configured to achieve a good result.
- Show how you can understand and analyze the output files.

<div style="text-align: justify">
A series of tutorials have been developed aiming to accomplish these objectives. 

They have been designed in order of difficulty, starting for a simple calculation that will permit to introduce the basic concepts of the program, and increasing the complexity of the systems object of study which will allow to show the different options of configuration and advanced settings.
